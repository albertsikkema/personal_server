# Claude.md - Project Documentation Reference

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Principles

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simplicity should be a key goal in design. Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible. Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug.

YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Avoid building functionality on speculation. Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future.

Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle enables flexibility and testability.

Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Design your systems so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code.

## ðŸ¤– AI Assistant Guidelines

### Context Awareness

- When implementing features, always check existing patterns first
- Prefer composition over inheritance in all designs
- Use existing utilities before creating new ones
- Check for similar functionality in other domains/features

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Creating duplicate functionality
- Overwriting existing tests
- Modifying core frameworks without explicit instruction
- Adding dependencies without checking existing alternatives

### Workflow Patterns

- Preferably create tests BEFORE implementation (TDD, Test Driven Development)
- Use "think hard" for architecture decisions
- Break complex tasks into smaller, testable units
- Validate understanding before implementation

### Testing Best Practices

- When writing tests make sure to use tokens that are acceptable to gitguardian, like "fake.token"

## ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Functions should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Classes should be short and focused sub 50 lines of code** and have a single responsibility.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
