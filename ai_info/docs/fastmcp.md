TITLE: Accessing MCP Context in a FastMCP Tool (Python)
DESCRIPTION: This example illustrates how a FastMCP tool can access MCP features like logging, resource reading, and progress reporting through the `Context` object. By adding a parameter with the `Context` type hint to the tool function, developers can use `ctx.info()`, `ctx.read_resource()`, `ctx.report_progress()`, and `ctx.sample()` to interact with the MCP environment and client LLM. The `process_data` function demonstrates reading data from a URI, reporting processing progress, and summarizing content using the client's LLM.

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

@mcp.tool()
def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Divide a by b."""

    if b == 0:
        # Error messages from ToolError are always sent to clients,
        # regardless of mask_error_details setting
        raise ToolError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    
    # If mask_error_details=True, this message would be masked
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.")
        
    return a / b
